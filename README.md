# Basic-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization

#### The fundamentals of data analysis and visualization in python. Here are some of the most important python tools for data science, Python in conjunction with scientific computing and graphing libraries to analyze data and make presentable data visualizations.

This course is designed for both beginners with some basic programming experience or experienced developers

looking to explore the world of data science.

So let's see a brief overview of the topics covered in this course.

We'll be covering none pi.

Pandas, matplotlib, Seabourne and Plomley.

We'll begin by learning how to create and manipulate arrays with NUM Pi, which is the core python package

for scientific computing.

Next, we'll learn the basics of pandas.

We use pandas to read in data from files and structure it with series and data frames.

We'll also learn how to do some quick analysis on our data.

We'll look at how to create various types of charts with matplotlib and then customize them to be more

attractive and modern with the use of Seabourne.

Finally, we'll take our charts to the next level by making them interactive.

Using Plomley, which is currently one of the leading data science tools.
